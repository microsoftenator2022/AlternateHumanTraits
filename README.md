# Alternate Human Traits

# New version can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/AlternateRacialTraits)

A mod for Owlcat's Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous.

Every race except humans have extra choices during character creation.
This mod adds [several alternate traits from the tabletop rules](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/Human/#Alternate_Racial_Traits).

## Features

So far, the added traits are:
 * Adoptive Parentage (only playable non-human races for now)
 * Awareness
 * Comprehensive Education
 * Dual Talent
 * Focused Study
 * Giant Ancestry
 * History Of Terrors (the base game still has this as a feat. You can only select one or the other)
 * Military Tradition
 * Practiced Hunter
 * Unstoppable Magic

More may be added in the future

## Missing/In progress:
 * Icons for more of the traits.
 * Localization

## Install Instructions
 1. Download the mod from the releases page
 2. Using [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) - on the mods tab, drag the zip onto the window
